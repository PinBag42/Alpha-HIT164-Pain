        Music. One of Man's greatest achievements.<br>
    	Since before written history, humans have been hitting something against something else because they like how it sounds, and even in this modern digital age, we are no different.<br>
        But for simplicitiy, let us look at one use of music in the current day and age.<br>
        Memes.<br>
        Or more specifically the "Dr Livesey" memes, also known more simply as the "Phonk" memes.

    <h4>What <i>is </i>Phonk?</h4>

    <blockquote >
        For the uninitiated, "Phonk" music is a subgenre of hip hop and trap music. While the original version of Phonk has changed alot, a dark and slow repeating beat one would often hear in a rave or a cheap bar with a DJ who forgot what tunes to play and simply resigned themself to making a quick beat to appease the drunken masses, the current version still holds itself worthy of the name.<br>
        <br>
        As for the example used to describe modern day "Phonk"... that is both easy and hard. The easy answer would be <a href="https://youtu.be/Hh5jEQraXaw">Ghostface Playa's "Why Not"</a>, a popular choice for the meme that is explained below. However, the hard answer is a bit more complicated but has a short answer. The internet has both moved on and hasn't at the same time. Memes can be popular one day and be considered "dead" the next, and that is no different for music.<br>
        However, that does not mean the "Dr. Livesey" memes have lost their humour, but rather it has transitioned to a form of endearment. Artists and creators from all around the globe, all making their own version of the meme to the point that it becomes a note of pride amoungst the community it is based around.<br>

   <blockquote>
    Originally from the 1988 russian animated adaption of Robert Stevenson's "Treasure Island", this meme centres around the usage of three characters; Jim Hawkings, Dr. Livesey, and Squire Trelawney. Each bringing a unique body-type to the meme. But also with the passing of time, the meme itself has evolved and changed, with some versions changing the beat of the song used, or by changing the start of the meme with a person saying "aw shit" instead the russian excerpt from the film, "For you, the words "Rum" and "Death" have the same meaning.", or even either neitheror a combination of the two, like the one seen <a href="https://youtu.be/6XglcbMssJs">this version.</a>

<br>
   Just look below at the varients. Each was made by a different person, each out of their own free time. Animating is not an easy task, and yet each of these individuals spent their own time and money to create something that only a niche part of the online community would notice, care to watch, or even enjoy. And yet they did it anyway. And that is the beauty of memes, it is not born of the question of "why?", but rather, "why not?"

    If you are curious as to the original source material to this meme, then you can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/QKRG7PF73UA">here</a>. As you might guess, it is in russian, but it has english subtitles, and much like the Disney "Treasure Planet", it's worth a watch.
